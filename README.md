# MIPS-Processor
MySPIM will demonstrate some functions of MIPS processor as well as the principle of the datapath and the control signals of MIPS processor. The MySPIM simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS does cycle-by-cycle.
